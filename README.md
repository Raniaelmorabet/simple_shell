## <ins>*_PID & PPID_*
**A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid):**
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
* ###  **Note in the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.**
##### *Each process has a parent: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the getppid system call (man 2 getppid), from within the child process*
### <ins>Exercises
#### <ins>0.getppid
**_Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process. Run your program several times within the same shell. It should be the same. Does echo $$ print the same value? Why?_**
#### <ins>1./proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
**_Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be._**
### <ins>Arguments
#### The command line arguments are passed through the main function: int main(int ac, char **av);
* **av is a NULL terminated array of strings**
* **ac is the number of items in av**
#### av[0] usually contains the name used to invoke the current program. av[1] is the first argument of the program, av[2] the second, and so on.
